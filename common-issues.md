**Debean**
You're getting the exact same error on Debian, which confirms that the issue is indeed your `snapd` version being too old to handle the `core20` base snap required by Sublime Text.

The message:
"error: cannot perform the following tasks:

  - Ensure prerequisites for "sublime-text" are available (cannot install snap base "core20": snap "core20" assumes unsupported features: snapd2.61 (try to refresh snapd))"

This means:

  * **`core20` requires `snapd` version 2.61 or higher.**
  * **Your current `snapd` is older than 2.61.**
  * **The solution is to update `snapd`.**

Here's how to fix it on Debian:

**1. Update your package lists:**

It's always a good idea to refresh your package information before installing or upgrading anything.

```bash
sudo apt update
```

**2. Install or upgrade `snapd`:**

This command will install `snapd` if it's not already installed, or upgrade it to the latest version available in your Debian repositories.

```bash
sudo apt install snapd
```

**3. Verify `snapd` installation (optional but recommended):**

You can check the installed `snapd` version to confirm it's updated.

```bash
snap version
```

Also, you can check the status of the `snapd` service:

```bash
systemctl status snapd
```

If it's not active, you might need to enable it:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket
```

**4. Install the `core` snap:**

Sometimes, `snapd` needs the `core` snap to be explicitly installed and up-to-date for other snaps to function correctly.

```bash
sudo snap install core
sudo snap refresh core
```

**5. Create a symbolic link for classic confinement (often needed on Debian):**

This step ensures that snaps requiring "classic" confinement (which many desktop applications do, including Sublime Text) can function properly.

```bash
sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
```

**6. Log out and log back in (or restart):**

This is crucial to ensure that your system's PATH and other environmental variables are correctly updated to include Snap's directories. A full reboot is the most guaranteed way, but logging out and back in usually suffices.

**7. Try installing Sublime Text again:**

After performing the above steps, attempt to install Sublime Text using Snap again:

```bash
sudo snap install sublime-text --classic
```
